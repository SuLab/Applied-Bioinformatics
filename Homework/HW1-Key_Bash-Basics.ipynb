Here we are going to leverage the `%%bash` 'magic command' in the jupyter python kernel to execute bash commands in the notebok directly. More information on magic commands can be found in the [documentation of the python kernel](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interactive/magics.html). If you want to call bash commands using the R kernel, you will utilize the [`system`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/versions/3.6.2/topics/system) function in R.\n",
