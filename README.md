# Applied Bioinformatics
Welcome to the Applied Bioinformatics course offered at [The Scripps Research Institute](https://www.scripps.edu//). </br>
Course materials from previous years are available [here](https://github.com/SuLab/Applied-Bioinformatics/tree/master). </br> 

Instructors: Dr. Andrew I Su ([@andrewsu](https://github.com/andrewsu)) and Dr. Sabah Ul-Hasan ([@sabahzero](https://github.com/sabahzero)) </br>
Teaching Assistants (TAs): Huitian Yolanda Diao ([@Huitian](https://github.com/Yolanda-HT)), Karthik Gangavarapu ([@gkarthik](https://github.com/gkarthik)), Shang-Fu Chen ([@ShaunFChen](https://github.com/ShaunFChen)) </br> 

This course is available in [2] parts and operates under the Computational Biology & Bioinformatics (CBB) core track: </br>
* Unit A:    Fundamentals of Scientific Computing (FSC), 4 weeks (1 credit) </br>
1. Learn and utilize the Bash (Unix shell) for file manipulation and navigation of the file system </br>
2. Learn and utilize R code to perform exploratory data analysis of data in files </br>
3. Learn and utilize Jupyter Notebook for R code </br>
4. Learn and utilize Git and GitHub for code versioning (tracking changes of source code) </br>
* Units B-C: Applied Bioinformatics and Computational Biology (ABCB), 8 weeks (2 credits) </br>
1. Learn the fundamentals of RNA-Seq, and its application in the larger biological research schema. </br>
2. Application of R in analyses of RNA-Seq data, from raw data to publishable statistics and figures. </br>
3. Practice and present on learned R skillset through published data via Capstone project. </br>
4. Understand and practice of peer review through self-evaluation and evaluation of peers. </br> 

The reasoning for this internal breakdown of the course is to give individuals an opportunity to "learn from scratch" and then go more in-depth, or choose either or path (solely partake in Unit A or Units B-C) depending on the individuals' needs. </br>

## Prerequisites

* An enthusiasm for learning, at whatever level of experience you may or may not be
* A Windows 10 or MacOS laptop (inform instructors if you need access to one of these)
* Software installation prior to arrival (by Sep 4th @ 5 PM PST): </br>
Command line (for Unix shell), R, and Jupyter Notebook (using Anaconda, includes Python 3) [here](Configuration.md) 
* Expectations: Individuals following this course either on their own or for credit should conduct professional and considerate behavior, likewise for TAs and Instructors. Individuals can typically anticipate feedback within a 48-hour time period during typical business hours.

## Schedule at a Glance

Each week consists of two 90-minute classes starting at 8:15 AM PST and ending at 9:45 AM PST from Sep 8th through Dec 10th, paired with one homework assignment (per week, weeks 1-9, 8 assignments in total). Within each class are two 45-minute sessions comprising of ~15-min lectures and ~30-min hands-on exercises with a brief recap at the end of the 90-minute period. </br>

## How to Get Help? 
1. Is there a possibility the answer to my question is available online?
If the answer is available, post the original question and answer you found [as an Issue](https://github.com/SuLab/Applied-Bioinformatics/labels) with the 'question' label. Be sure to close the issue with the answer you found (including relevant resource links) after opening it. You will need [a Github account](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_XsJIHSLRg) to do this.
2. If the answer is not available online, post it as a question-labeled Issue and pend for a response from the Instructors or TAs. Who knows, perhaps another student had also encountered the same issue and can answer it too!
3. If the obstacle is something more personal, such as a specific installation issue unique to your computer alone, reach out to the instructors. Any question is better than no question at all, and often we all learn from them (not just students)!
