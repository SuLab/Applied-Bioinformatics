# Installing git

You will be following the links and instructions at https://git-scm.com/downloads

## MacOs
* follow the "homebrew" instructions, which boil down to executing these two commands in your Terminal application:
    * `/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"`
    * `brew install git`
       
## Ubuntu Linux
* Execute `apt-get install git`.  If you see any errors, try `sudo apt-get install git`.

## Windows
* The installer will ask you what you'd like to make the default editor. Unless you know the difference between the different options, select "Nano"
* Select the "Override the default branch name for new repositories" option. Leave the default of "main".
* Choose all other defaults.
