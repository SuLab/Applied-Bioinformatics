However, the panel **C** is an advanced one for students seeking for challenges, which might need more libraries and combined knowledge from previous lecture. Therefore, extra points will be applied to your total grades if achieving the **FULL figure** - including the **3 panels joint together** with proper **customized transparent color**, **font size/style**, **shared legend and axis scale**, **readable labels/titles** and **aspect ratio = 3:1**, **high resolution** output (dpi=300). Note we won't cover the potential solution (build your own coding style!!) but it's common requisites for a formal publication.
