This file contains instructions for how to install terminal (for command line), jupyter notebook (as part of anaconda, which includes python 3), and R (as well as the R kernel for jupyter notebook) on your personal computer. Instructions are provided based on MacOS or Windows 10.  If you do not have access to a MacOS or Windows 10 computer, contact the course instructors. 

## Mac OS *note to scroll to bottom after completing steps 1-5 ['Confirm installations']

### 1. install python3 and jupyter using anaconda
* follow installation instructions for python3.6 at https://www.anaconda.com/download#macos <br><br>
*Note: You can install jupyter to a pre-existing conda environment via
```
jupyterPath <- "/miniconda/envs/env_name/bin"
jupyterPath2 <- paste(Sys.getenv("HOME")
"/miniconda/envs/env_name/bin",sep="")
```
then continue with the rest of the instructions below

### 2. install R
* download and install R-4.0.2.pkg from https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/

### 3. install xcode-select
* open a terminal and run `xcode-select --install`

### 4. configure R kernel
* launch R
* execute these commands
```
jupyterPath <- "/anaconda3/bin"
jupyterPath2 <- paste(Sys.getenv("HOME"),"/anaconda3/bin",sep="")
Sys.setenv(PATH = paste(Sys.getenv("PATH"),jupyterPath,jupyterPath2,sep=":"))
install.packages(c('repr', 'IRdisplay', 'evaluate', 'crayon', 'pbdZMQ', 'devtools', 'uuid', 'digest'))
devtools::install_github('IRkernel/IRkernel')
IRkernel::installspec()
```

### 5. start jupyter
* launch terminal
* From the bash prompt, execute `jupyter notebook`. You should see output like this: 
```

## Confirm installations
* Are you able to open identify and open terminal on your computer? Y/N
* Does a browser automatically open to a Jupyter Notebook page showing your files? Y/N </br>
Type `jupyter notebook --version` in your terminal to confirm you have *v6.0.3* installed
* In your Jupyter notebook, are you able to initiate a new Python3 script? Y/N</br>
Type `python --version` in your terminal to confirm you have *v3.8.3* installed
